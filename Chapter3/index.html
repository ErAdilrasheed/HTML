    <h1>Creating A Page Layout</h1>
    <p>When we use the right tag in right place, it results in a better page layout better indexing by search engines
        and better user experience. <br>  We use the following tag to get the job done</p>
        <img src="one.PNG" width="600px" alt="image"> <br>
        Inside the main tag we insert the following tags: <br>
        <img src="two.PNG" width="600px" alt="image"> <br>
        Creating a page like this is not necessary but it creates a readable & structured layout Also they are useful for SEO. <br>
        <h3>Link Attributes</h3>
        <img src="three.PNG" width="600px" alt="image"> <br>

        We can put any content inside an anchor tag (imeges, headings etc are all allowed). <br>
        If the page is inside a directory, we need to make sure that We link to the correct page. <br>
        We can links to image like this. <br>
        <img src="four.PNG" width="600px" alt="image"> <br>
        <h3>The DIV tag and the Span Tag</h3>

        <strong>Div tag</strong> - <p>div tag is often used as a container for other elements div is a block level element.
            â†’ Always takes full width</p>

        <strong>Span tag</strong> - <p>Span is an inline container - (Span
            Takes as much width as necessary)</p>
